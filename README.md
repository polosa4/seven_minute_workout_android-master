7 Minute Workout Android Application
=======

This application was developed to guide users through the [7 Minute Workout that was mentioned in the May/June 2013 issue of ACSM's Health & Fitness Journal](http://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx).

The application was developed using [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) and supports Android 4.x devices. It makes use of the [Youtube Android API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/android/player/) to display videos natively within the application.

This application can be found on Google Play: [7 Minute Workout](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.michaelcarrano.seven_min_workout).

Roadmap
=======
There is a lot that can be done to improve this application and below is just a short list of improvements I will be working on in the future.

* Add sound cue in between workout/rest so the user does not need to always look at the app.
* Improve layouts
	* Test layouts on all different screen sizes and densities.
	* Allow orientation change for [WorkoutCountdownActivity](https://github.com/michaelcarrano/seven_minute_workout_android/blob/master/7%20Minutes/src/main/java/com/michaelcarrano/seven_min_workout/WorkoutCountdownActivity.java)
	* Improve [CircularProgressBar](https://github.com/michaelcarrano/seven_minute_workout_android/blob/master/7%20Minutes/src/main/java/com/michaelcarrano/seven_min_workout/widget/CircularProgressBar.java) widget.
		* It skips a tick in the beginning (30 seconds to 28 seconds when exercising or 10 seconds to 8 seconds during rest)
* Handle orientation change for Youtube videos.
	* Videos play from beginning when orientation changes, instead of continuing with the video.
* Add ability to customize the exercise and rest countdown time.
* Add ability to randomize the workout order.
* Add ability to log your workout.
* ~~Explore supporting Android 2.3.x devices.~~
